Hello my name is Shamil it is nice to meet you. 👋

🚀 Electronics & Communication Engineering Student

🎓 B.Tech ECE | Tech Enthusiast | Problem Solver

I really love figuring out how hardware and software work together. This means I get to learn about electronics and embedded systems. I also get to learn about the tech that happens behind the scenes, which is called backend tech and how all of this is used in real-world applications. I find it really interesting to see how hardware and software are used in real-world applications.

🔧 What I am, into

⚡ Electronics & Communication Engineering

💻 Programming & Backend Development

🤖 Embedded Systems & IoT

📡 Communication Systems

I like to make things that really work in life. Building projects is what I do. I want them to be useful in the real world. When I build something I want to know that it will actually do what it is supposed to do. Building projects that actually work in the world is very important, to me.

🌱 Currently Learning

Advanced ECE concepts

Java & Spring Boot

Databases (PostgreSQL)

System design basics

I am really open, to working on things 🤝 Open to Collaborate On projects and stuff. This is a way for people to meet and make new things happen. Let us work together on something and see what we can do with Open to Collaborate On ideas.

ECE final-year & mini projects
